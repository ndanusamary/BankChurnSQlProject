# 🧠 Customer Churn Insights with SQL

This SQL project dives into a bank’s customer churn dataset to generate actionable insights, identify churn patterns, and support data-driven strategies aimed at improving customer retention and overall profitability. Through comprehensive SQL queries, the project answers a wide range of business questions—transforming raw data into meaningful information that can directly influence decision-making in marketing, customer service, and product development.

## 🔍 Key Areas of Analysis

### 📌 Basic Customer Insights
This section provides foundational metrics that help understand the overall customer landscape:

- Total number of customers  
- Gender and geography-based distributions  
- Average age and account balance  
- Breakdown of churned vs retained customers  

### 📊 Behavioral Trends & Patterns
Using deeper segmentation, this section uncovers patterns that influence customer churn:

- Churn rates segmented by geography, tenure, age group, and credit score range  
- Analysis of how the number of products held affects churn likelihood  
- Influence of active membership and credit card ownership on churn  
- Balance and salary groupings to evaluate financial behavior and churn correlation  

### 📈 Business Decision Support
These insights help businesses take action by focusing on high-impact segments:

- Identification of high-balance customers who still churned (potential high-value losses)  
- Segmentation of customers into risk profiles based on balance, activity, and churn status  
- Churn comparisons across gender and geography combinations  
- Product-holding trends linked to churn behavior (e.g., single vs multiple product customers)  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- SQL – Structured Query Language for all data querying and manipulation  
- SSMS / PostgreSQL – SQL Server Management Studio or equivalent RDBMS platform  
- Data aggregation, filtering, grouping, and conditional logic (CASE statements) to derive insights  

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to empower stakeholders—such as analysts, marketers, and executives—with a better understanding of who their customers are, why they may be leaving, and how to proactively address retention challenges. By leveraging SQL for robust data exploration, the project transforms customer churn data into a strategic tool for business growth.
